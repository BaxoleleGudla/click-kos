üîê Security & Compliance

Secrets:

NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHABLE_STRIPE_KEY = frontend only.

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = backend only (API routes, Edge Functions).

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = Edge Function only.

Compliance:

No sensitive card data is stored.

Only store minimal metadata (order_id, amount, status).

Aligns with POPIA by avoiding unnecessary personal data storage.


### End-to-End Flow

Client calls POST /payments ‚Üí gets redirectUrl.

Client redirects user to Stripe Checkout.

Stripe processes payment ‚Üí calls webhook (PUT /payments/:id/status or Supabase Edge Function).

Webhook verifies + updates DB.

Client polls GET /payments/:id to confirm status.
